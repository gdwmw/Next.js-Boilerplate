# Next.js Boilerplate Documentation

Boilerplate By [Gede Dewo Wahyu M.W](https://github.com/gdwmw) ❤️

## Boilerplate Description 📖

This boilerplate is a web application built using Next.js, which is a React framework for web application development. The boilerplate includes various features such as authentication, theme management, state management, form validation, and more. Additionally, this boilerplate follows the principles of Atomic Design for organizing components.

### Structure Explanation 📚

- **/auth**: Contains authentication-related files and logic.
- **/public**: Contains static assets such as images, animations, and other static files.
- **/src/app**: Contains the main application pages, including login, admin, user, and others.
- **/src/components**: Contains reusable components throughout the application, organized following the principles of Atomic Design.

# Special AI Instructions for Creating Code Structure Diagrams

1. **Format**:

   - Use Markdown format.
   - Use headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) for titles and subtitles.

2. **Icons**:

   - Use the following icons to identify components:
     - 📄 for **Page**.
     - 📦 for **Main** or **Layout**.
     - 📝 for **Content** or content components.
     - 🧭 for **Nav**.
     - 📐 for **Aside**.
     - 🦶 for **Footer**.

3. **Structure**:

   - Create a hierarchy using indentation (use `-` for lists).
   - Each component must have a link to the file path (example: `[📄 HomePage](src/app/page.tsx)`).

4. **Section Titles**:

   - Use section titles for each part (example: `### 🏠 **Home**`).

5. **Important**:

   - Create the structure according to the actual structure in the codebase. This is just an example, so adjust it to the current codebase.
